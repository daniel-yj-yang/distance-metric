# distance_metric
A collection of distance metrics

<hr>
1. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance">Euclidean_distance</a> (= Euclidean norm = L<sup>2</sup> norm)

The square root of the sum of the squares of the differences between corresponding values.

<hr>
2. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_absolute_deviations">L<sup>1</sup> norm/distance</a>

The sum of the absolute differences between corresponding values.
Also known as least absolute deviations (LAD), least absolute errors (LAE)

3. Mahalanobis distance

A very nice explanation can be found <a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/62092/bottom-to-top-explanation-of-the-mahalanobis-distance">here</a>
Ma-ha-la-nobis distance is a measure of distnace between points in a given distribution
It is unitless and scale-invariant.

When the distribution (in terms of the covariance matrix) is an identity matrix, the distance is the same as the Euclidean distance.
